Node Size or Weight:
Suggestion: Add a "weight" or "size" field based on node importance (e.g., 10 for function_definition, 5 for call with vulnerabilities, 3 for others).
Why: In a 3D force-directed layout, larger nodes could represent key functions or risks, improving visual hierarchy.
Dependency Links:
Suggestion: Add "dependencies" to nodes referencing modules (e.g., "import_from_statement" could have "dependencies": ["test"]) or functions (e.g., "idk" could link to "new").
Why: Allows D3.js to draw edges between code and its dependencies, showing module relationships.
Collapsed Function Bodies:
Suggestion: For large functions, add a "collapsed": true flag and move "children" to a separate "body" field, expandable on interaction.
Why: Keeps the initial tree compact in D3.js, letting users drill down into fd() or idk() as needed.
Error Handling Metadata:
Suggestion: If parsing fails or ambiguities arise (e.g., unresolved imports), add an "errors" field (e.g., "errors": ["Unresolved function: foo"]).
Why: Future-proofs the AST for real-world codebases with issues, visible in the visualization.
Tree Structure:
Current: Nested JSON with "children" arrays, perfect for D3’s hierarchical data.
Suggestion: Use D3’s d3.hierarchy() to convert this into a tree, then d3-force-3d for a 3D force-directed layout.
Interactivity:
Zoom/Pan: Enable users to explore the tree (e.g., zoom into fd()’s body).
Click to Expand: If a "ref" is present, clicking could fetch and display the full definition dynamically.
Tooltips: Show "Text" on hover to reveal source code.
Visual Cues:
Colors: Use "color" (red for vulnerabilities, blue for library calls, green for variables).
Node Size: Scale by depth or importance (e.g., function_definition larger than call).
Edges: Connect calls to their called_function definitions (using "id" or "ref").
User Understanding:
Functions: function_definition nodes as major branches, with "id" for navigation.
Variables: Highlight nodes with "variables", possibly showing key-value pairs in tooltips.
Vulnerabilities: Emphasize red nodes with alerts or animations.
