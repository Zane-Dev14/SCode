# SCode Analyzer Fixes and Improvements

## ES Module Conversion

- Converted all JavaScript files to use ES modules
- Updated `package.json` with `"type": "module"`
- Added proper ES module imports/exports
- Updated webpack config for ES module support
- Added Babel configuration for ES module transpilation

## Shader System Improvements

1. **FBM Implementation**
   - Added proper Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM) implementation based on [yiwenl/glsl-fbm](https://github.com/yiwenl/glsl-fbm)
   - Created `fbm.glsl` to provide high-quality noise functions for the shaders

2. **Shader Loading Fix**
   - Improved shader loading mechanism in `main.js` to properly load shader scripts
   - Added error handling and fallbacks for shader loading
   - Corrected shader paths in `extension.js`

3. **Uniform Naming Consistency**
   - Standardized uniform and attribute naming in all shaders
   - Fixed inconsistencies between shader variables and JavaScript code

## Project Structure Fixes

1. **Package.json**
   - Consolidated dependencies from `media/package.json` into the root `package.json`
   - Added proper scripts for building both the extension and UI components
   - Standardized dependency versions

2. **Webpack Configuration**
   - Added `copy-webpack-plugin` to copy shader files to the dist folder
   - Added raw loader for GLSL files
   - Fixed module resolution for external libraries

3. **File Organization**
   - Created proper setup script to streamline installation
   - Added helper scripts for development workflows
   - Improved project documentation

## JSX Components Fixes

1. **React Component Loading**
   - Fixed library loading in the webview HTML
   - Ensured proper order of loading scripts and shaders

2. **Extension Integration**
   - Improved communication between VS Code extension and webview
   - Added better error handling for rendering issues

## Other Improvements

1. **Documentation**
   - Updated README with clear setup instructions
   - Added troubleshooting section
   - Documented the shader system

2. **Error Handling**
   - Added fallbacks for missing uniform values in shaders
   - Improved error reporting in the extension
   - Added graceful degradation for shader errors

3. **Development Experience**
   - Added utility scripts for development workflows
   - Improved build process for faster iteration
   - Added clear console logs for debugging

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Testing**
   - Add test cases for components
   - Create shader testing mechanism

2. **Performance**
   - Optimize shader complexity for larger code bases
   - Add level-of-detail controls

3. **Accessibility**
   - Add keyboard navigation controls
   - Improve color contrast options

4. **TypeScript Support**
   - Consider adding TypeScript support
