# Summary of Fixed Issues in SCode Analyzer

This document summarizes the issues we encountered and the fixes implemented to resolve them.

## Issue 1: VSCode API Acquisition Error

**Problem:**
```
Uncaught Error: An instance of the VS Code API has already been acquired
```

**Cause:**
The VSCode API was being acquired multiple times - once in the HTML template via `acquireVsCodeApi()` and again in the main.js file.

**Solution:**
1. Removed duplicate acquisition in main.js
2. Used `window.vscode` consistently throughout the code
3. Ensured all message passing used `window.vscode.postMessage()`

## Issue 2: Node-Fetch Function Errors

**Problems:**
```
u is not a function
c is not a function
```

**Cause:**
Compatibility issues with the node-fetch library, which has changed significantly between versions and has issues with certain environments.

**Solution:**
1. Completely replaced node-fetch with a custom implementation using Node.js's built-in http module
2. Created a compatible API that mimics fetch but doesn't rely on external dependencies
3. Added proper error handling and debugging for network requests
4. Removed node-fetch from package.json dependencies

## Issue 3: Python Server Connection Issues

**Problem:**
Failed connections to the Python backend server, particularly during health checks.

**Cause:**
Combination of timing issues, port availability problems, and error handling gaps.

**Solution:**
1. Added proper error handling for the HTTP requests
2. Improved the Python server startup process with retries
3. Added port availability checking
4. Increased timeouts and delays to ensure processes complete properly
5. Added more robust error logging

## Issue 4: Message Passing Between Webview and Extension

**Problem:**
Messages from the webview weren't being properly received by the extension.

**Cause:**
Inconsistent use of the VSCode API for message passing.

**Solution:**
1. Standardized all message passing to use `window.vscode.postMessage()`
2. Enhanced error handling for message processing
3. Added timeout and retry mechanisms for operations that might fail

## Other Improvements

1. **Documentation:**
   - Created comprehensive troubleshooting guides (TROUBLESHOOTING.md, QUICK_FIX.md)
   - Added specific documentation for custom implementations (QUICK_FIX_CUSTOM_FETCH.md)
   - Updated README.md with common error solutions

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Added extensive error logging throughout the codebase
   - Implemented proper cleanup on failures
   - Added timeouts for operations that might hang

3. **Environment Handling:**
   - Added cross-platform port checking (Windows/Linux/macOS)
   - Improved virtual environment setup and validation
   - Added output directory creation if missing

4. **Build Process:**
   - Simplified the build process by removing external dependencies
   - Ensured compatibility with different Node.js environments

These changes make the extension more robust and easier to troubleshoot if issues occur.
