Node Size or Weight:
Suggestion: Add a "weight" or "size" field based on node importance (e.g., 10 for function_definition, 5 for call with vulnerabilities, 3 for others).
Why: In a 3D force-directed layout, larger nodes could represent key functions or risks, improving visual hierarchy.
Dependency Links:
Suggestion: Add "dependencies" to nodes referencing modules (e.g., "import_from_statement" could have "dependencies": ["test"]) or functions (e.g., "idk" could link to "new").
Why: Allows D3.js to draw edges between code and its dependencies, showing module relationships.
Collapsed Function Bodies:
Suggestion: For large functions, add a "collapsed": true flag and move "children" to a separate "body" field, expandable on interaction.
Why: Keeps the initial tree compact in D3.js, letting users drill down into fd() or idk() as needed.
Error Handling Metadata:
Suggestion: If parsing fails or ambiguities arise (e.g., unresolved imports), add an "errors" field (e.g., "errors": ["Unresolved function: foo"]).
Why: Future-proofs the AST for real-world codebases with issues, visible in the visualization.
Tree Structure:
Current: Nested JSON with "children" arrays, perfect for D3’s hierarchical data.
Suggestion: Use D3’s d3.hierarchy() to convert this into a tree, then d3-force-3d for a 3D force-directed layout.
Interactivity:
Zoom/Pan: Enable users to explore the tree (e.g., zoom into fd()’s body).
Click to Expand: If a "ref" is present, clicking could fetch and display the full definition dynamically.
Tooltips: Show "Text" on hover to reveal source code.
Visual Cues:
Colors: Use "color" (red for vulnerabilities, blue for library calls, green for variables).
Node Size: Scale by depth or importance (e.g., function_definition larger than call).
Edges: Connect calls to their called_function definitions (using "id" or "ref").
User Understanding:
Functions: function_definition nodes as major branches, with "id" for navigation.
Variables: Highlight nodes with "variables", possibly showing key-value pairs in tooltips.
Vulnerabilities: Emphasize red nodes with alerts or animations.

# Visualization Implementation Plan

## Core Technologies
- Three.js - 3D rendering, scene management
- React Three Fiber - React bindings for Three.js
- D3.js - Data binding, force simulations
- GSAP - Advanced animations
- React - Component-based UI
- Shaders - GLSL custom effects, particles

## Loading Screen
- Particle system with code symbols floating in 3D space
- Animated progress indicator with gradient glow
- Dynamic text transitions showing analysis steps
- Background with animated shader gradient (noise-based)
- Pulsing light effects around loading indicators

## Main Visualization Components
- 3D force-directed graph for code structure
- Node types: functions, modules, variables, vulnerabilities
- Edge types: calls, dataflow, dependencies
- Color coding based on type/importance/vulnerabilities
- Interactive hovering effects with glow/pulse
- Custom shader for nodes/edges highlighting

## Interaction Features
- Orbit controls for camera movement
- Zoom to specific nodes/clusters
- Pan across visualization
- Click to expand/collapse function nodes
- Search/filter functionality
- Focus mode on selected components
- Timeline scrubber for code execution path

## Advanced Visual Effects
- Bloom/glow effects on important nodes
- Particle effects along dataflow paths
- Ambient occlusion for depth perception
- Animated transitions between views
- Custom node geometries based on type
- Dynamic edge thickness based on importance

## Implementation Steps
1. Convert React components to use React Three Fiber
2. Create custom shaders for nodes/links/background
3. Implement force-directed layout using D3 + Three.js
4. Add interactivity handlers for nodes/camera
5. Build shader-based loading screen with particle effects
6. Create responsive layout supporting different view modes
7. Add animations for transitions, expansions, highlighting
8. Implement backend path handling for entrypoint files

- three.js, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei, @react-three/postprocessing
- d3-force-3d, d3-hierarchy
- gsap, framer-motion
- react, react-dom
- custom GLSL shaders

## Performance Optimizations
- Instanced mesh rendering for similar nodes
- Level-of-detail rendering based on distance
- Worker thread for force calculations
- WebGL2 for advanced rendering features
